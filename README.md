# CS50 SQL Projects

This repository contains the SQL projects I completed as part of Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. These projects showcase my ability to work with databases, write SQL queries, and solve real-world problems using structured data. Each project focuses on different aspects of SQL, including database creation, querying, filtering, and optimization.

## Overview

The projects in this repository were completed as part of the SQL-focused section of CS50. These tasks required the application of SQL concepts to extract meaningful information from datasets, solve problems, and analyze data efficiently. The projects emphasize:

- Database schema design.
- Writing complex SQL queries.
- Aggregating and filtering data.
- Solving logical problems using data analysis.

## Projects

### 1. Fiftyville SQL Mystery

In this project, I used SQL to solve a mystery in a fictional town called Fiftyville. The challenge involved analyzing a database containing information about people, transactions, and locations to determine:

- Who stole the duck?
- Where the thief escaped to?
- Who was their accomplice?

This project honed my skills in writing nested queries, using joins, and analyzing datasets with multiple interrelated tables. I also practiced logical reasoning and problem-solving while navigating through the provided data.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Writing and executing SQL queries with multiple joins and conditions.
- Filtering and sorting data using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions.
- Analyzing complex datasets to uncover hidden relationships.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL:** The primary language used for database querying.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight database engine used for running SQL queries locally.
- **CS50 IDE:** An integrated development environment provided by the course for running queries and testing solutions.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

The projects in this repository demonstrate distinctiveness by requiring:

1. **Real-world Problem Solving:** Each project replicates a real-world scenario where SQL is used to extract actionable insights from data.
2. **Complex Query Construction:** Tasks involve creating queries with multiple joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
3. **Logical Reasoning:** The Fiftyville SQL Mystery, in particular, required not just technical SQL knowledge but also logical thinking to connect seemingly unrelated pieces of information.

## Setup Instructions

To explore these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
2. 

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cs50sql-projects
   ```

4. Open the provided `.sql` files in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQLite, MySQL Workbench) or use the CS50 IDE.

5. Load the database (if applicable) using:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 database.db
   .read schema.sql
   ```

6. Execute queries to solve the tasks provided in the project documentation.
